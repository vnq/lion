## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 6ea02988: Always use ...styles and [css``] everywhere consistently, meaning an array of CSSResult. Makes it easier on TSC.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- f3e54c56: Publish documentation with a format for Rocket
- 5db622e9: BREAKING: Align exports fields. This means no more wildcards, meaning you always import with bare import specifiers, extensionless. Import components where customElements.define side effect is executed by importing from '@lion/package/define'. For multi-component packages this defines all components (e.g. radio-group + radio). If you want to only import a single one, do '@lion/radio-group/define-radio' for example for just lion-radio.

### Patch Changes

- af90b20e: Only show success feedback if the user is recovering from a shown error/warning.
- Updated dependencies [f3e54c56]
- Updated dependencies [5db622e9]
  - @lion/core@0.15.0
  - @lion/localize@0.17.0

## 0.8.5

### Patch Changes

- dbacafa5: Type static get properties as {any} since the real class fields are typed separately and lit properties are just "configuring". Remove expect error.

## 0.8.4

### Patch Changes

- 6b91c92d: Remove .prototype accessor when accessing super.constructor from a constructor. This causes maximum call stack exceeded in latest chrome.
- 701aadce: Fix types of mixins to include LitElement static props and methods, and use Pick generic type instead of fake constructors.
- Updated dependencies [701aadce]
  - @lion/core@0.14.1
  - @lion/localize@0.16.1

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- b2a1c1ef: Make sure prev validation result is always an array (of validators) and not undefined.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- d0b37e62: Do a deep equals check for choice group children that have complex modelValues, enabling modelValue setter to work on the group level.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- deb95d13: Add data-tag-name manually to scoped child slottables as the ScopedElementsMixin only does this transform for elements inside render templates.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b2f981db: Add exports field in package.json

  Note that some tools can break with this change as long as they respect the exports field. If that is the case, check that you always access the elements included in the exports field, with the same name which they are exported. Any item not exported is considered private to the package and should not be accessed from the outside.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b2f981db]
  - @lion/core@0.14.0
  - @lion/localize@0.16.0

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

### Patch Changes

- f98aab23: Make \_\_parentFormGroup --> \_parentFormGroup so it is protected and not private
- f98aab23: Make \_\_toggleChecked protected property (\_toggleChecked)

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 8fb7e7a1: Fix type issues where base constructors would not have the same return type. This allows us to remove a LOT of @ts-expect-errors/@ts-ignores across lion.
- 9112d243: Fix missing types and update to latest scoped elements to fix constructor type.
- Updated dependencies [8fb7e7a1]
- Updated dependencies [9112d243]
  - @lion/core@0.13.8
  - @lion/localize@0.15.5

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a8cf4215: Added `isTriggeredByUser` meta data in `model-value-changed` event

  Sometimes it can be helpful to detect whether a value change was caused by a user or via a programmatical change.
  This feature acts as a normalization layer: since we use `model-value-changed` as a single source of truth event for all FormControls, there should be no use cases for (inconsistently implemented (cross browser)) events like `input`/`change`/`user-input-changed` etc.

### Patch Changes

- 5302ec89: Minimise dependencies by removing integration demos to form-integrations and form-core packages.
- 98f1bb7e: Ensure all lit imports are imported from @lion/core. Remove devDependencies in all subpackages and move to root package.json. Add demo dependencies as real dependencies for users that extend our docs/demos.
- Updated dependencies [a8cf4215]
- Updated dependencies [98f1bb7e]

### Patch Changes

- 2907649b: filter feedback messages according feedback conditions

- fd297a28: Properly update formElements when the name attribute changes, in order to get an updated serializedValue.
- 9fcb67f0: Allow flexibility for extending the repropagation prevention conditions, which is needed for combobox, so that a model-value-changed event is propagated when no option matches after an input change. This allows validation to work properly e.g. for Required.
- 247e64a3: Ensure that the name of a child choice field is always synced with the parent choice field(set) when it changes. No longer error when a child is added with a different name than the parent, simply sync it.

- b9327627: These packages were using out of sync type definitions for FormatOptions, and the types were missing a bunch of options that Intl would normally accept. We now extend Intl's NumberFormatOptions and DateTimeFormatOptions properly, so we always have the right types and are more consistent on it.
- 02145a06: for ChoiceInputs override clear() so modelValue doesn't get erased
